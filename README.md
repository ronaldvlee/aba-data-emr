This project is an EMR (Electronic Medical Records) portal system designed specifically for Applied Behavioral Analysis therapists. The system allows therapists to manage and track patient data, create treatment plans, and adjust patient behaviors.

## User Stories

1. As a therapist, I want to add a new month to each treatment plan so that I can track the progress of each plan over time.
2. As a therapist, I want to add new treatment plans so that I can manage multiple treatment plans for different patients.
3. As a therapist, I want to create a new dataset for each treatment plan and each month so that I can track the progress of each plan separately and over time.
4. As a therapist, I want to input patient data into the corresponding treatment plan and month dataset so that I can track their progress over time.
5. As a therapist, I want to graph patient data from each treatment plan and month so that I can visualize their behavior and progress.
6. As a therapist, I want to adjust patient behaviors based on the treatment plan and month so that I can help them improve.
